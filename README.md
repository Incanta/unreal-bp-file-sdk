# Unreal Blueprint FileSDK

This is an Unreal Engine plugin to give you blueprint nodes for various File IO/Management tasks.

Some, but not all, of the things this plugin lets you do:
- Read/write files as text or binary
- Random access file reading (read a specific part of the file and not all of it)
- Read directory contents with detailed file info
- Search directories for files/directories
- Rename files/directories
- Copy files/directories

## Compiling for UE4

To compile for UE4, delete `FileSDK.uplugin` (or rename to `FileSDK.uplugin.ue5`) and rename `FileSDK.uplugin.ue4` to `FileSDK.uplugin`.

## Documentation

## Marketplace

This asset is available **FOR FREE** on the Unreal Engine Marketplace at https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/blueprint-file-sdk.

Any and all enhancements will be made to this plugin and will continue to be free; there won't be a "paid pro version." We don't believe in the whole bait-and-switch ploy. We hope you enjoy it!

## Donations

Here at Incanta Games, we strongly believe that content should be available for indie developers at a reasonable price. Lots of other vendors price gouge to take advantage of devs who don't have the chops to do some coding. We continue to strive to help you bring magic to the world in your games by making sure plugins are reasonably cheap or free. We'll keep doing this, but if you want to help support this mission you can give us a tip at https://ko-fi.com/incanta. Any and all donations are much appreciated and help us continue to make more awesome content for you!
