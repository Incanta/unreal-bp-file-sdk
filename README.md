## Donations

Here at Incanta Games, we strongly believe that content should be available for indie developers at a reasonable price. Lots of other vendors price gouge to take advantage of devs who don't have the chops to do some coding. We continue to strive to help you bring magic to the world in your games by making sure plugins are reasonably cheap or free. We'll keep doing this, but if you want to help support this mission you can give us a tip at https://ko-fi.com/incanta. Any and all donations are much appreciated and help us continue to make more awesome content for you!
